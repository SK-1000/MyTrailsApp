# MyTrailsApp

This is an app which allows adventurers to save a list of all of their favourite trails. A user can sign up, then log in. They can view an about page or dashboard page. 
The dashboard allows the user to add a new trail list, they user can upload an image as part of the trial list. Within the traillist, the user can add many trails. 
The fields relating to trails are Trail Name, category Terrain Descripion, Trail starting point, Longitude and Latitude to startpoint of trail and the distance in km of the trail.
A user can also delete the trail.  

There is also a menu item which will allows an admin user access to view and remove users of the MyTrails App. As a future phase, I would like to update the code so that only
certain users have admin access.

I would also in a future phase, make it possible for a non-signed up user to view all of the trails uploaded by users on the dashboard within a map. It would be great if they could
choose to view these trails by category i.e. terrain description.
